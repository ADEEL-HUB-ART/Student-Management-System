Student Management System (Backend API)

This project is a complete backend system for managing academic and administrative data of a school or university. It is built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL, and secured with JWT authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student).

The system allows institutions to manage students, departments, subjects, academic results, fees, and clearance status in a structured and secure way. It also provides analytical features such as GPA/CGPA calculation and an admin dashboard for system-wide statistics.
