## Student Management System API (FastAPI)

This project is a production-ready backend for managing academic and administrative data in a school or university.
It is built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **PostgreSQL/SQLite**, secured with **JWT authentication**
and **role-based access control** (`admin`, `teacher`, `student`).

The system manages students, departments, subjects, results, fees, and clearance, and exposes analytics such as
GPA/CGPA and dashboard statistics.

---

### Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - `POST /signup` – register new users
  - `POST /login` – issue JWT access tokens
  - Role-based access control using `admin`, `teacher`, and `student` roles

- **Core Academic Management**
  - Students: CRUD operations on `students`
  - Departments: CRUD via `/departments`
  - Subjects: CRUD and per-department / per-semester listing

- **Results & Analytics**
  - Record results with midterm, final, and sessional marks
  - Compute **GPA** per semester and overall **CGPA**

- **Fees & Clearance**
  - Track total, paid, and due amounts for student fees
  - Multi-stage clearance: library, finance, hostel, department

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Aggregate statistics for students, fees, clearance, and average GPA

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite (default for development)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Auth**: JWT (`python-jose`)
- **Validation**: Pydantic models

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set:
   # SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret
   # DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database  # or use the default SQLite URL
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Open the UI**

   - Human‑friendly landing page: `http://localhost:8000/`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Authentication Details

- First, create a user via:

  - `POST /signup`

- Then log in with:

  - `POST /login`

- Use the returned token in the `token` header for protected endpoints:

  ```http
  token: <your-jwt-token>
  ```

Admins and teachers have access to additional routes such as department management, result creation, fees,
clearance, and the dashboard.
